# instance-id.sh — per-process runtime instance identity.
#
# A Claude Code `session_id` is NOT unique across parallel
# `claude --continue` / `--resume` processes (#93): the second process re-fires
# SessionStart with the *original* session_id, so two live processes claim to
# be the same session. Keying watcher/lock state (pidfile, watermark, actas
# owner) on session_id alone makes those two processes collide — most visibly
# the watch.sh "kill the previous holder for this session" logic (#66) turns
# into a mutual kill loop.
#
# We disambiguate by composing the session_id with the enclosing agent process
# pid, which IS unique per live process. The resulting "instance id":
#   - is stable across /clear within one agent process (sid + pid unchanged),
#     so the #66 dedup-on-relaunch still works;
#   - differs between parallel resume processes (different pid), so their
#     pidfile / watermark / actas owner stop colliding.
#
# Token shape:
#   "<session_id>.<pid>"   composite — pid is the enclosing agent process
#   "<session_id>"         bare — fallback when the agent pid can't be resolved
#                          (detached watcher, sandboxed ps, non-agent wrapper)
#
# session_ids are UUIDs / "agmsg-<...>" / "unknown-<pid>" — none contain a '.',
# so "last dot-segment is numeric" unambiguously marks the composite form.
#
# Requires: SKILL_DIR set. agmsg_instance_id / agmsg_normalize_instance_id
# additionally require resolve-project.sh sourced (for agmsg_agent_pid);
# agmsg_instance_alive and the pure helpers do not.

# Guard against double-source (these are sourced transitively via actas-lock.sh
# and directly by entry-point scripts).
